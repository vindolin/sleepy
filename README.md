## Windows daemon process that checks if the computer has not been used for n minutes and then puts it into standby mode.

Do an internet search for "windows won't go to sleep" and you know why I made this ðŸ˜ .

It checks the output of ```powercfg /requests``` for processes that should prevent the computer from going to sleep.

It also checks mouse and keyboard events to see if the user is using the computer.

If none of this is detected, the computer is put into standby using `psshutdown.exe -d`.

The time to sleep is configurable through the SLEEP_AFTER_MINUTES constant.

### Installation
This script needs the tool [psshutdown.exe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psshutdown) from the Windows Sysinternals suite to put the computer into standby.

The only python dependency is pynput (for checking keyboard/mouse activity).

```
pip install pynput
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
This script needs to be run in administrator mode because ```powercfg /requests``` doesn't work as normal user.
